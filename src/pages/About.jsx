            Hey there! 👋 I'm Harry P. Oyarvide, an enthusiastic sales application engineer on an exciting journey into the tech world. I'm particularly passionate about back-end development and cloud computing with AWS. My background in electrical engineering, combined with my growing expertise in JavaScript, SQL, Python gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving and innovation.
