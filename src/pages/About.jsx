            Hey there! 👋 I'm Harry P. Oyarvide, an enthusiastic sales application engineer on an exciting journey into the tech world. 
            I'm particularly passionate about back-end development and cloud computing with AWS. My background in electrical engineering, 
            combined with my growing expertise in JavaScript, Node, SQL, REACT gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving and innovation.
            What drives me? The thrill of crafting elegant solutions and the endless possibilities in tech. When I'm not coding or learning new technologies, 
            you'll find me hiking trails with my family and our adventurous dog, Xena. 🏃‍♂️🐕 F1 fanatic...love fast cars.
            I'm on a mission to combine my engineering mindset with cutting-edge tech skills to create impactful solutions. 
            Every day, I'm taking steps toward my goal of becoming a skilled full-stack developer, fueled by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning. 
            Let's build something amazing together! 🚀
